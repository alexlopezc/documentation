A *Thematic App* is a specific version of the geobrowser, in which specific parameters are pre-defined, in order to serve a specific thematic.
It is defined by a list of services offerings, such as:

	- web widget,
	- map layer,
	- map background,
	- data series,
	- wps services
	- ...

The pre-defined thematics are:

	- Niger river (see :doc:`Niger River <niger_river>`)
	- Red river (see :doc:`Red River <red_river>`)
	- Global Hydrological Modeling (see :doc:`Global Hydrological Modeling <global_hydro_model>`)
	- WOIS CloudToolbox (see :doc:`WOIS CloudToolBox <wois_app>`)

All users also have an application dedicated to the management of all items he owns (see :doc:`My Worspace <workspace`>).
It is call **My worskpace** and will give to the user the ability to manage (edit / share / delete) all items he owns amongst WPS services, data collections, data packages, WPS jobs.

From this "workspace", users can also manage (create / edit / delete) their own *Thematic App* (see :doc:`My Thematic Apps <workspace`>).
